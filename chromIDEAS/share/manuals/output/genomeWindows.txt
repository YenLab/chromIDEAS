1. windows.bed: Segment the genome into 200bp windows based on hg38.chr10.sizes file, 
which include all genomic regions.
  - col1: chromosome name
  - col2: start (0-based)
  - col3: end (0-based)

2. windowsNoBlack.noid.bed: Segment the genome into 200bp windows based on hg38.chr10.sizes 
file, which exclude hg38-blacklist.chr10.bed region from genome.
  - col1: chromosome name
  - col2: start (0-based)
  - col3: end (0-based)

3. windowsNoBlack.withid.bed: Bin IDs are added to windowsNoBlack.noid.bed.
  - col1: chromosome name
  - col2: start (0-based)
  - col3: end (0-based)
  - col4: Bin ID
