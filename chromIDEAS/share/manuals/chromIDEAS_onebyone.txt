================= [[ Run analysis one by one with subcommands ]] =================
Each tool should be called by its own name as in the following example:
 $ s3v2Norm -i input/ -o s3v2_norm/ -m ./metadata.txt -p 10

[ Tools for Genomic Windows Bin Bed Creation ]
  genomeWindows           Segment the genome into equally sized and contiguous bin. Output used  for S3V2 
                          normalization.

[ Tools for BigWig file Normalization ]
  bigWig2bedGraph         Convert bigwig file format to bedgraph file format with specific windows bin as 
                          the standard.
  s3v2Norm                Simultaneously normalize the Signal in peak regions and the Signal in background 
                          regions of epigenomic data sets.
  mergeBedgraph           Merge the replicated data of a sample.
  bedGraph2bigWig         Convert bedgraph file format to bigwig file format.

[ Tools for Chromatin State Assignment ]
  ideasCS                 Assignment chromatin states with position-dependent and cell type-specific information.
  clusterCS               Cluster all chromatin states based on similarity between them. (to be continued)
  enrichFunctionElement   Function elements enrichment analysis. (to be continued)
  stateCompare            Compare the similarity and difference between two chromatin state results. (to be continued)
  chromDCSCG              Differential Chromatin-modified Genes analysis. (to be continued)

[ Tools for QC ]
  stateMatrix             Prepare the chromatin state matrix
  plotProfile             Plots metaplot over user selected regions using signal value. (to be continued)

[ Tools for Input and Output Explanation ]
  explainIO               Give detailed explanation for Input data and Output results of subcommand. (to be continued)
